School point counting system

## About

Since I'm going to be teaching some classes on my former high-school and the system that's currently used there, I decided to create one of my own. It's a simple Phoenix app with Google OAuth (the school all their accounts in Google Workspace).

The feature set is currently very limited. It allows you to create and edit classes, add students to them and assign points. Definitely not trying to reimplement Google Classroom here, they are meant to be used pretty much together.
